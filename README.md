# Advanced Scientific Calculator

This is an advanced scientific calculator application written in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the math module for performing mathematical calculations.

## Features
- The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) along with advanced mathematical functions.
- It provides functions for trigonometric operations (sin, cos, tan) and their inverse (sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹).
- Other features include calculating the square root, calculating powers (x² and xʸ), factorial (!), natural logarithm (ln), logarithm with base 10 (log), and constants (π and e).
- The calculator allows input of decimal numbers and handles floating-point arithmetic.
- You can clear the expression with the "C" button and delete the last character with the "⌫" (backspace) button.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script (`calculator.py`) is located.

3. Run the application by executing the following command:
   ```
   python calculator.py
   ```

4. The calculator GUI will appear with the expression entry box at the top and a grid of buttons for various operations and functions.

5. To perform calculations, click the buttons for the numbers and operations in the desired order.

6. To perform a trigonometric operation, click the respective "sin", "cos", or "tan" button. To calculate the inverse of the trigonometric functions, click the "sin⁻¹", "cos⁻¹", or "tan⁻¹" button.

7. To calculate the square root, click the "√" button. For calculating powers, use the "x²" and "xʸ" buttons.

8. To calculate the factorial, click the "!" button.

9. Constants such as π and e can be inserted into the expression by clicking their respective buttons.

10. The result of the expression will be displayed in the entry box after clicking the "=" button.

11. To clear the current expression, click the "C" button.

12. To delete the last character in the expression, click the "⌫" (backspace) button.

## Important Note
- The calculator uses the `eval()` function to evaluate the mathematical expressions. Be cautious while using it, especially when dealing with untrusted input, as it can execute arbitrary code.
